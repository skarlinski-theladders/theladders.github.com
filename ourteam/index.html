    <strong>Dmitri Mikhailov</strong> is Principal Data Architect for TheLadders. Since joining the Company in 2004 he&#8217;s had to wear many hats: writing code for both the website and internal tools, designing data structures, optimizing payment systems among many other things. While moving all these disparate bits around (many!), he&#8217;s never panicked in those inevitable “the site is down!” situations. Dmitri is able to communicate in 15 different languages, including binary codes with a wide range of computers: from IBM 360 mainframes to tiny PLCs. His latest hobbies include 3D graphics, Linux kernel programming, studying the Chinese language, and trophy fishing.

    <strong>Andrew Turley</strong> is a Lead Software Engineer at TheLadders. A Midwesterner by birth but a coastal elitist by choice, he likes watching the sun rise and set over large bodies of water. He lives in Brooklyn&#8217;s Crown Heights with his wife and cat, tending to his small garden and keeping a watchful eye on his overburdened bookshelf. His only career regret is that has has not deployed a single line of COBOL.

    <strong>Avital (ah-vee-tahl) Tzubeli</strong> is a Software Engineer at TheLadders. Despite her passion for writing and cleaning code, she almost majored in Art in order to feed her love for messing around with digital media. She is an EDM junkie and doesn&#8217;t believe in &#8220;relaxation music.&#8221; In her free time, she enjoys cooking, working out, and organizing her perpetually messy bedroom (while listening to EDM, of course).
